Original repo is here: https://github.com/jk3064/Custom-Unit-Shader-Framework
Authors couldn't be bothered to get it working with the latest engine. What exists here is a congomoration from Evo, BA and ZK.

The original repo contains files that shoudl in theory let you actually load them up in the engine as if it were a real mod. However, as of writing this, they simply don't work and as mentioned, the Authors (JK, Gajop) have declined to get them working for the latest engine (104.0+).

The files here are an attempt to keep a clean copy that will just work(tm) if dropped into a game.
